\end{center}

Anomaly detection is essential for managing today’s large-scale distributed systems, where system logs are a key resource for identifying unusual behavior. Traditionally, system operators relied on manual inspection methods such as keyword searches and rule-based matching. However, due to the massive volume and complexity of modern system logs, manual approaches are no longer practical. To tackle this, many automated log-based anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Still, developers often struggle to choose a suitable method, as there hasn't been a clear comparison of these approaches.

In this research, I will propose a solution to addresses the fundamental challenge of automated log analysis. Specially, the research tackles three interconnected problems: (1) automated parsing of diverse log formats into structured templates, (2) anomaly detection in high-volume log streams, and (3) generation of contextual, actionable recommendations for identified issues.

Previous research has established some foundational approaches including the algorithms for log parsing and machine learning techniques for anomaly detection. However, existing solutions typically focus on individual components rather than providing end-to-end integration. Most academic implementations lack production-ready deployment architectures, user-friendly interfaces, and the integration of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent recommendations—creating a significant gap between theoretical algorithms and practical deployment. Therefore, this research is important since it close the gap between academic log analysis algorithms and production-ready systems. 

Furthermore, the research establishes a framework for integrating emerging LLM capabilities into traditional system administration workflows, suggesting broader implications for AI-assisted DevOps practices. The findings indicate that intelligent automation of log analysis is not only technically feasible but can significantly enhance organizational capabilities in system reliability, security monitoring, and operational efficiency.
