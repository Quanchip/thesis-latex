\end{center}

Anomaly detection is essential for managing today’s large-scale distributed systems, where system logs are a key resource for identifying unusual behavior. Traditionally, system operators relied on manual inspection methods such as keyword searches and rule-based matching. However, due to the massive volume and complexity of modern system logs, manual approaches are no longer practical. To tackle this, many automated log-based anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Still, developers often struggle to choose a suitable method, as there hasn't been a clear comparison of these approaches.

In this research, I will propose a solution to addresses the fundamental challenge of automated log analysis. Specially, the research tackles three interconnected problems: (1) automated parsing of diverse log formats into structured templates, (2) anomaly detection in high-volume log streams, and (3) generation of contextual, actionable recommendations for identified issues.

Previous research has established some foundational approaches including the algorithms for log parsing and machine learning techniques for anomaly detection. However, existing solutions typically focus on individual components rather than providing end-to-end integration. Most academic implementations lack production-ready deployment architectures, user-friendly interfaces, and the integration of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent recommendations—creating a significant gap between theoretical algorithms and practical deployment. Therefore, this research is important since it close the gap between academic log analysis algorithms and production-ready systems.

Furthermore, the research establishes a framework for integrating emerging LLM capabilities into traditional system administration workflows, suggesting broader implications for AI-assisted DevOps practices. The findings indicate that intelligent automation of log analysis is not only technically feasible but can significantly enhance organizational capabilities in system reliability, security monitoring, and operational efficiency.

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\section{Background of the study}


In modern software systems, log files serve as critical sources of information
for system monitoring, debugging, troubleshooting, and security analysis. As applications or systems scale and increase its complexity,
the volume of generated log data gets bigger exponentially. Therefore, traditional manual approaches
for log analysis like manually examine through log files using basic tools such as grep or text
editors, has become less efficient and more defective \cite{author2023}. As the result,
it is becoming more difficult to detect anomalies within large scale system.

Over the year, a lot of automated log-based methods have been introduced to help detecting
system anomalies. These approaches usually require raw log preprocessing techniques, feature extraction
and machine-learning-based algorithms for processing vast amounts of
unstructured log data efficiently, identifying potential issues before they
escalate into critical failures. Recent advancements in natural language processing
and large language models (LLMs) have also increased the potential for
intelligent log analysis systems. However, despite these development, traditional machine-learning techniques and LLM-based approaches have yet to be efficiently integrated
into a single, cohesive log analysis framework.

This study focuses on leveraging existing machine learning approaches where log parsing and anomaly
detected are used, and augmenting them with large language model to provide  actionable insights and helpful recommendations.


\section{Problem Statement}

Despite the important role of log analysis that play in making the system more secure and reliable,
several significant challenges still persist in current practices:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Limited interpretability.} In log anomaly detection,
          the ability to interpret model's outputs is important for people who
          work as system administrators or analysts to effectively action to
          the alerts. They need to understand which log entries may be responsible
          for the detected abnormality. Yet, many traditional approaches only
          provide basic classified prediction without any explanation. As a result,
          engineers still have to perform further manual root cause analysis
          which in large-scale and complex systems becomes an very time-consuming
          and heavy task.

    \item \textit{Poor adaptability.} Many existing methods rely on a predefined
          set of log event templates during feature extraction phase (This phase will use the set of log event templates generated by
          log parsing to create numerical features for machine learning models \cite{SARHAN2024205}).
          However, as applications scale up and expand  in term of feature,
          new and unseen log events will definitely appear. Therefore, adapting to these
          changes require retraining models from scratch which make the systems become less practical
          in dynamic environments.

    \item \textit{Poor adaptability.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives of the Study}

This study will perform the investigation on existing anomaly-detection
methodologies, compares the performance of different machine-learning
models, and develops a practical framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) to automate and improve anomaly detection in real-world scenario.



\section{Limitations of the Study}


\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}

\section{Introduction to system log}

System logs, also known as event logs or audit trails, are automically generated by
a computer system (its operating system, services, applications) that record events, changes and error that
occur inside that system. These log files serve an important role in monitoring system
health, diagnose failures, detecting anomolies, and ensure system security and complience \cite{STUDIAWAN20191}.
System logs usually follow a semi-structured format which consist of several fields that capture
both the context and content of the event.\\[10pt]

    \caption{This is the descriptive text that explains the figure.}
    % \label{fig:my_image} % The label for cross-referencing
\end{figure}

Figure 2.1 show a log snippet that was generated by HDFS DataNode, one of the core storage components in the Hadoop ecosystem
(a more detail explanation of this system will be provided below).
These log entries are created from the storage operations of the system such as
data writes, packet handling, and communication between DataNodes. A log entry typically follow a structure as follow:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Timestamp: 2016-10-02 12:24:52,337.} Indicates the exact moment when the system processed the event.

    \item \textit{Log level: INFO.} Shows that the entry reports normal operational activity

    \item \textit{Log message: org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataNode.clienttrace:...} Log messages provide a structured description of system behavior,
          capturing events, performance indicators. This is the most important part of a log entries and therefor become the
          foundation for monitoring, auditing and anomaly detection.

\end{itemize}

Given their important role in providing such essential information about the system, logs must be reliably collected,
centrally stored and appropriately maintained  to enable accurate monitoring, troubleshooting, and subsequent analytical processes.

\section{Traditional log analysis method}

Traditional log analysis have relied on two primary approaches (cite something): manual log inspection and rule-based pattern matching systems.
While these techniques are the foundation of the system administrators fields and troubleshooting, it were used during the time
when the system complexity and log volumes were much smaller than nowadays modern systems. Understanding the strengths and limitations of
these approaches will provide you a better context and insights of logs which will enhance your log analysis systems.


\subsection{Manual Log Inspection}

Manual log inspection is one of the earliest and most straightforward methods used by system
administrators to identify issues. In this approach, developers or administrators will
directly operate searching on raw log files using command-line tools such as \verb|grep| , \verb|tail|, \verb|less|,
to locate error logs or correlate timestamp of the incidents. While feasible for small log volumes, this method is very
time-consuming, highly error-prone and relies heavily on an operator’s familiarity with the system. Therefore, this approach
is no longer a feasible solution for detecting anomalies in large-scale systems which may produce millions of log entries
per hour. For instance, in 2013 the Alibaba Cloud system was reported to generate approximately 100 to
200 million log lines in one hour \citep{6410318}.

\subsection{Rule-Based Systems (Regex and Pattern Matching)}

To counter the limitations of manual log review, developers created rule-based system that used fixed rules, regular expressions (regex),
and predefined patterns to filter, parse, and identify specific events when a specification conditions are met.
For example, system operators can create rules to detect keywords such as "ERROR", "FAILED" or extract key information
from log entries. Rule-based methods offer some advantages: they are easy to implement and effective for detecting
obvious or recurring errors. Many traditional monitoring tools such as Nagios, Splunk (early versions)
\cite{splunk_field_extraction}, and Logstash \cite{logstash_grok},
they are heavily depend on popular pattern-matching techniques to filter, categorize, and index log data.

However, the effectiveness of rule-based approaches highly depend on the completeness and accuracy of the
hand-crafted predefined rules. It will become more defective in a constantly evolving environments where logs
format change frequently and new types of anomalies will appear which do not match the existing patterns. Maintaining
large sets of regex rules is also a labor-intensive action and require continuous manual updates on patterns which is
unsuitable for adaptive anomaly detection.



\section{Log parsing}


\section{Machine learning and deep learning for log anomaly detection}

As system continuously scaled and logs volumes grew bigger, manual or rule-based approaches is
no longer available. As a result, researchers began to adopt machine learning to automate
anomoly detection. These methods are created to enable it to learn the structures, numerical representations,
and patterns of logs without depending on predefined rules or templates. These approches are often categorized as
supervised or unsupervised learning.
